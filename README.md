## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed. [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that. (It's generally a few years behind.)

note: If you got error `the font "FontAwesome" cannot be found`, try double click `/Awesome-CV-master/fonts/FontAwesome.ttf` to install this font manually. See [this issue](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/issues/166).

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
$ xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

This should result in the creation of `{your-cv}.pdf`
